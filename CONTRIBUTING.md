## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

We try to implement the project we some Clean Code principles and practices:

- KISS (Keep it simple, stupid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- DRY (Don't repeat your self https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- SSOT (Single Source Of Truth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth)
- YAGNI (You aren't gona need it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
- WABI-SABI (Accept imperfections of code https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/12/17/software-is-imperfect/)
- SOC (Separation Of Concerns https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
- MODULARITY (High cohesion low coupled modules http://principles-wiki.net/principles:low_coupling http://principles-wiki.net/principles:high_cohesion)
- DEMETERS LAW (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)
- LOD (Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)
- STUPID (Singleton, Tight Coupling, Untestability, Premature Optimization, Indescriptive Naming, Duplication, donâ€™t be STUPID: Be GRASP and SOLID https://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/)
- SOLID: SRP (Single responsibility principle), OCP (Open / closed principle), LSP (Liskov substitution principle), ISP (Interface segregation principle), DIP (Dependency inversion principle) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)
- GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design))
